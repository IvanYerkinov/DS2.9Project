# DS2.9Project
# Project: ML Model that can classify the behavior of mice based on annotated video frames.

This project is perfect for 6 weeks worth of work for two main reasons. One is that I am still new to handling images with complex ML Models. It would be a great use of my time to really internalize how they work and what I can do with them so that I can carry that knowledge to future projects with ML models. Furthermore this project will also have me study how to work with the outputs of a ML model and how to properly tune a Model to get the exact type of results I want. Secondly, classification is a very varied topic and can be used for many different things. Starting with this project would not only give me a baseline understanding of working with a classification ML it would also create a base on which I can build future classification models. The minimum viable product is a model that can classify a single video of mice running around. The strech goal is a model that can classify any video of mice running around with a great degree of accuracy.

As stated before, the scope of this project fits with both my personal skill level as well as the 6 week timeline. The learning curves builds upon concepts introduced in the previous DS class I was a part of, and into more advanced topics that I would like to learn more about. The storage requirements for this project will also be simple, needing not more than enough space for a sequence of training and testing images, since the output of the model is simply a series of numbers in an array.

From all the articles I have read, people have developed plenty of ML Models that can tell the similarities and differences between two images.

Over the course of the project I want to build a Model that will classify an annotated video of rats moving with behavioral tags. I plan on spending one and a half weeks on building the models. One week on fine-tuning the model. Half a week on preparing the model for presentation as well as any last minute changes that need to be done.
