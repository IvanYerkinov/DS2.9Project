# DS2.9Project
# Project: ML Model that tells the difference between a real photograph of a person and one generated by a ML Model/Photoshop. 

This project is perfect for 6 weeks worth of work for two main reasons. One is that I am still new to handling images with complex ML Models. It would be a great use of my time to really internalize how they work and what I can do with them so that I can carry that knowledge to future projects with ML models. Furthermore this project will also have me study how to work with the outputs of a ML model and how to properly tune a Model to get the exact type of results I want. Secondly I believe that a project like this will be vital to the development of Internet based communication, with the rise of ML Models that can create images realistically depicting things that do not, and have not ever existed, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that one day they will be used for malicious purposes. Therefore I believe that at least starting a project that can counter the existence of these realistically false images by being able to differentiate between them and the real deal via a mathematical model is beneficial on both a personal scale to people who need, and potentially a industry wide or society wide scale, especially in fields such as journalism, law enforcement, and government affairs.

As stated before, the scope of this project fits with both my personal skill level as well as the 6 week timeline. The learning curves builds upon concepts introduced in the previous DS class I was a part of, and into more advanced topics that I would like to learn more about. The storage requirements for this project will also be simple, needing not more than enough space for a sequence of training and testing images, since the output of the model is a simple True/False statement, nothing more will be required.

From all the articles I have read, people have developed plenty of ML Models that can tell the similarities and differences between two images. Many of these are CNNs and tell you if two images depict the same or different things. Furthermore Adobe has developed AI systems in their software that can detect specifics within images fed to them, and even edit those images to achieve specific effects. I.e, Adobe SmartCrop automatically determines the focus of an image and proceeds to crop the image in such a way that emphasizes its focus. Or Photoshop can automatically age or de-age a person in a photo, or colorize a black and white photograph. Furthermore there's been a study conducted on building an ML Model that can not only spot differences between images but also describe what the differences are. However I have not been able to find an example of a ML model that was specifically designed to tell the difference between photoshopped or otherwise generated images and the real things.

Over the course of 6 weeks, I would like to at the very minimum, develop a ML model that can tell the difference between either a photoshopped image or an image generated by a ML Model and a real photograph of that thing. If time permits, I would like to expand the model to be able to handle both inputs, and if by some miracle I still have time left over, I would like to have the “explain” how it came to the conclusion that it did.
My plan at the moment is to spend the first couple weeks in study and preparation for the task I’ve set myself, building a simple model to be able to accept images and have it at least output a True/False statement even if it's inaccurate most of the time. The next couple of weeks will be spent on fine tuning the model and trying to make it work quickly, efficiently, and most importantly accurately. With the final couple weeks spent on last minute tweaks and optimizations.
